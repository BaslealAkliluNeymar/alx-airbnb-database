ðŸ“¦ ALX Airbnb Database Project
This project is part of the ALX Airbnb Database Module, focusing on designing, normalizing, and building a robust relational database system that simulates a real-world Airbnb-like platform.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The goal is to design and implement a scalable and efficient relational database. You will use industry best practices to model, create, and populate the database, ensuring high data integrity and performance.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

Design complex relational database systems using advanced modeling techniques.

Apply normalization (up to 3NF) to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.

Use SQL DDL to define schemas with appropriate constraints, keys, and indexing.

Seed databases using SQL DML with realistic, production-style data.

Collaborate professionally through GitHub with proper documentation and version control.

ðŸ§  Prerequisites
To complete this project, you should be comfortable with:

Relational database concepts and SQL

Data modeling tools (e.g., Draw.io)

Normalization principles (up to 3NF)
